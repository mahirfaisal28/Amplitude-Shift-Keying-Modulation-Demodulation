Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is a form of amplitude modulation that represents digital data as variations in the amplitude of a carrier wave. This proposal includes a digital modulation scheme that works with unique pattern of binary digits. It involves various modulation parameters that are systematically varied to investigate the performance of ASK in terms of its efficiency and robustness for different communication scenarios. It provides a comprehensive review of existing literature to be conducted to gain a deeper understanding of ASK modulation, its theoretical foundations, and its applications in practical communication systems. A software simulation environment is to be developed to model the ASK modulation scheme using mathematical code and graphical representation for the implementation of BASK (Binary Amplitude Shift Keying) for a stream of bits.
